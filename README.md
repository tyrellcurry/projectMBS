## FAQ

#### What does this extension do?

This extension helps speed up development time for Marketo Guided Templates by automatically populating Marketo Variables in their correct places based on their Default value in the Meta Tag. It will also recognize True/False values in Boolean Meta Tags and populate the value accordingly.

You are no longer having to copy and paste your code within the Marketo Template Editor and clicking 'preview' to see your template's changes - you can now see your changes instantly within your browser when viewing the template locally!

- This extension works best when 'Live Previewing' your code using your favourite text editor or opening the file directly from your local folder.

- This extension will not interfere within Marketo Instances, it will only be automically triggered when viewing documents locally within Google Chrome.

#### How can I install it?

You can install it from the official [Google Chrome Webstore](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/).

If you would like cross-browser support or you'd rather not install the extension - you can paste this script directly within your project:

```
<script src="https://tyrellcurry.github.io/projectMBS/chrome-extension/mbs.js"></script>
```
